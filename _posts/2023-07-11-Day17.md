DAY-17

Hi ,reader it was my day 17 of training at **RYAZ.io** and today I worked on the project for desiging the webpage that I have started yersterday and today I worked on making it more correct:

* Developed responsiveness
* Watchcards
* Updated the symbol
* Adjust margins
* Developed color indicator

 and so on . I faced my diffculites in making webpage responsiveness but by using some properties of flex and grid I was able to do it . I also pushed code to github and  so that I tack track the diff for my codes. But I was not able to make it 100percent matchning to the design but I will be making it in  next Days so that my skills can be developed and I can design more webpages.
