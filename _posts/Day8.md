#DAY8
Hi reader today it was my day 8 of training at **RYAZ.io** today I learn very useflu concept of css related to layouts :
*  Box model
*  Box-sizeing
*  Overflowing
*  Flexbox
*  Grid
*  Measurments units
*  Positioning
*  Media Quries
   all the topics where vey intresting but both flex box and grid seems to be quite difficult to me but when I tried exercise on flex box I was able to solve it and but in grid I was able to soleve with the the mobile and tablet view but in laptop view I was facing the 1 bug of image postioning which I will be solving tomorrow .
