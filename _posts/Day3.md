#DAY-3

Hi reader today it was my 3rd day of training at RYAZ.IO 
Today I firstly started with completing my previous work i.e. to learning of GIT.Today I came to understand working,concept,different commnands and their flags

* git add
* git commit
* git merge
* git push pull
* git revert reset checkout
* git branch and its option
* git rebase
* remote repos
* git clone

and so on it was quite intresting to do but i also face some errors but at the end I got the solutions.
I also hosted my website to internet using github services. But I got also another task to setup my blog on github which today I was not able to setup I will try to setup tomorrow.
