Hi , reader today it was my day 28 of training at **RYAZ.io** today I learnt about:


* How to use window object
* How to find heght and width of window
* How to understand dom tree
* How to use eventlisstners
* Made a simple web page naviagtion bar
  ```javascript
  {
    let show=document.querySelector('selector');
    let reveal=document.querySelector('selector');
    function reveall(){
    if(reveal.classList.contains('reveal')){
        reveal.classList.remove('reveal');
    }
    else{
        reveal.classList.add('reveal');
    }}
    show.addEventListener('click',reveall)
  }
  ```
  

and so on. I have also undeerstand how to hide and unhide some content on html using events which also helped we to understand how the navigavition bar works on phone and I have made that so that I could undrstand more in detail. And I will be learning futher in next days.
